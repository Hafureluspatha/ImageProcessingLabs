# Image Processing Labs MISIS 2017

This repository contains finished assignments of the Bachelor Image Processing course at NUST MISIS.

The sole purpose of this repository is to be a proof that I worked with C++ and OpenCV. 

The code was not cleaned and is not maintained since 2017. Use at your own risk.
